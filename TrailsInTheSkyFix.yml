  # If enabled ingame camera will be scaled
  # `zoom` should never be a negative number
  # `zoom` of 1.0 is game default
  # The closer `zoom` gets to 0 the closer the camera will be zoomed in
  # The closer `zoom` gets to infinity the further away the camera will be zoomed out
  # WARNING: This is a 'for fun' feature firstly, zooming out the camera enough will
  #          cause you to see the entire current world map and may expose things you
  #          aren't supposed to see.
